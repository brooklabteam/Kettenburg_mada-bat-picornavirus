RAxML-NG was called at 06-Sep-2023 23:37:14 as follows:

raxml-ng-mpi --bootstrap --msa africa_picornaviridae_over1kb_align.fasta --model GTR+I+G4 --prefix T4 --seed 526 --threads auto{8}

Analysis options:
  run mode: Bootstrapping
  start tree(s): 
  bootstrap replicates: max: 1000 + bootstopping (autoMRE, cutoff: 0.030000)
  random seed: 526
  tip-inner: OFF
  pattern compression: ON
  per-rate scalers: OFF
  site repeats: ON
  branch lengths: proportional (ML estimate, algorithm: NR-FAST)
  SIMD kernels: AVX2
  parallelization: coarse-grained (auto), PTHREADS (auto)

WARNING: The model you specified on the command line (GTR+I+G4) will be ignored 
         since the binary MSA file already contains a model definition.
         If you want to change the model, please re-run RAxML-NG 
         with the original PHYLIP/FASTA alignment and --redo option.
