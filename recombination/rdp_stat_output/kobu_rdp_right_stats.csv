Table Key:
~            = It is possible that this apparent recombination signal could have been caused by an evolutionary
               process other than recombination.
*            = The actual breakpoint position is undetermined (it was most likely overprinted by a subsequent 
               recombination event).
^            = The recombinant sequence may have been misidentified (one of the identified parents might be the recombinant)
Minor Parent = Parent contributing the smaller fraction of sequence.
Major Parent = Parent contributing the larger fraction of sequence.
Unknown      = Only one parent and a recombinant need be in the alignment for a recombination event to be detectable.
               The sequence listed as unknown was used to infer the existance of a missing parental sequence.
NS           = No significant P-value was recorded for this recombination event using this method.
